# 🔄 **SQLFlow: The Future of Hassle-Free Data Pipelines**  

**SQLFlow** is an **open-source, metadata-driven automation framework** designed to eliminate the complexities of modern **data warehouse management, pipeline automation, and data governance**. Unlike traditional ETL frameworks, **SQLFlow features built-in schema evolution**, meaning it **automatically adapts to changing data structures**—ensuring a **hassle-free, zero-maintenance data delivery experience**.  

With SQLFlow, data engineers and architects can **build scalable, resilient, and future-proof data pipelines** without the constant overhead of manual schema updates or pipeline disruptions. SQLFlow is fully containerized and available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/businessiq/sqlflow/general), making deployment seamless across environments.


## ✨ **What Sets SQLFlow Apart?**  
🔹 **Automatic Schema Evolution** – Unlike other frameworks, SQLFlow dynamically adjusts to incoming schema changes, eliminating the need for manual intervention.  
🔹 **Zero Maintenance Pipelines** – Say goodbye to pipeline failures caused by evolving data structures.  
🔹 **Metadata-Driven Simplicity** – Automate everything—from data ingestion to governance—without writing custom scripts for every change.  
🔹 **Scalability at Its Core** – SQLFlow grows with your data, ensuring seamless performance at any scale.  

## 🏢 **Trusted by Leading Enterprises**  
SQLFlow is actively used by organizations optimizing large-scale data operations:  

- **Kolumbus AS** – Norway’s public transportation leader, managing data for buses, boats, and trams. 
- **Nortura SA** – Norway’s largest food supplier (23.545B NOK revenue), where SQLFlow supported critical data operations.
