# üîÑ Accelerator for Data Architecture

SQLFlow is an open-source, metadata-driven automation framework designed to simplify and streamline modern data warehouse management, pipeline creation, and data governance. Trusted by large enterprises in Norway, SQLFlow empowers data engineers and architects to efficiently build scalable, reliable, and maintainable data solutions. The solution is containerized and available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/businessiq/sqlflow/general), making deployment quick and straightforward across different environments.

## ‚ú® Key Benefits

- **Reduced complexity:** Automate pipeline generation and management with metadata-driven design.
- **Enhanced agility:** Effortlessly manage schema updates and data transformations.
- **Improved governance:** Achieve transparency and control through automated data lineage and impact analysis.
- **Optimized scalability:** Utilize containerized environments to scale vertically as needed.

## üè¢ Trusted by Norwegian Corporate Clients

SQLFlow has been implemented by established organizations:

- **Kolumbus AS** - A leading Norwegian company specializing in public transportation services, encompassing buses, boats, and trams.

- **Nortura SA** - Norway's premier food supplier with annual revenue of 23.545 billion NOK, where SQLFlow was partially implemented as a supplementary solution during my tenure there, not as the main framework.

## üîë Core Features

### Metadata-Driven Automation
Eliminate manual tasks by leveraging metadata to automate the end-to-end data warehouse processes, significantly increasing operational efficiency.

### Dynamic Data Pipelines
Automatically generate and manage data pipelines from defined metadata, ensuring seamless and error-free data flow from source systems to data targets.

### Effortless Schema Management
Automate schema creation, updates, and versioning dynamically, allowing teams to focus on data strategy rather than operational details.

### Robust Data Transformations
Utilize built-in transformation capabilities defined via metadata to perform complex, consistent, and maintainable data cleansing, enrichment, and standardization.

### Data Lineage and Impact Analysis
Gain comprehensive visibility into data flow, origin, and transformations with automated lineage tracking. This capability significantly improves data governance, regulatory compliance, and enables proactive impact analysis.

### Container-Based Vertical Scaling
Leverage Azure Container Instances and Ingress for responsive vertical scaling of SQLFlow APIs, optimizing performance and resource allocation during peak demand.

### Data Quality Assurance
Integrate machine learning techniques for proactive monitoring of data quality, anomaly detection, and historical trend analysis, ensuring high data integrity and reliability.

### MatchKey for Enhanced Data Integrity
Precisely monitor changes, including deletions, in source systems through the powerful MatchKey feature, offering customizable grace periods and flexible data lifecycle management aligned with business rules and governance policies.

### Data Mesh Acceleration
Accelerate adoption of data mesh architectures by seamlessly integrating SQLFlow as an automated ETL solution for rapid creation and management of Delta Lake environments.

### Source Control Integration
Facilitate data pipeline development and collaboration by integrating seamlessly with popular source control systems, streamlining pipeline versioning and change tracking.

### Scalable Performance
Ensure fast, reliable performance through pipelines built upon industry best practices, complemented by comprehensive logging for efficient debugging and tuning.

### Comprehensive Documentation
Easily onboard and maximize SQLFlow with detailed documentation covering everything from basic setup to advanced features.
